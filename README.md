# Conway-s-game-of-life

This is a program that runs Conway's game of life on a 100 by 100 field. 

You can start or stop a simulation. Resetting the simulation will yield a new field where 10 percent of the population is alive.

The eradicate and populate buttons will make the population density 20% or 80% respectively. The areas of eradication or population are chosen via 4 comboboxes. The first 2 indicate the top left corner of the rectangle in which the action will occur in coordinates (x,y). The last 2 will indicate the size of the rectangle in (x,y).

To import a given pattern, you have to create a text file with a 100 by 100 square of 1s or 0s, where the 1s will be live cells and 0s are dead cells. Note that the text file must be in the same folder as the code.
